# scan_and_search
Use this script to scan a target and search metasploit framework to see if there are any exploits in it that would probably work on that version. <br>
It's not perfect and does mess up, but if you watch it, it seems to work fine.<br>
I wrote this script with some help from chatgpt 4, and while it's not great, it's pretty alright.<br>
For use with bug bounties or ctfs.<br>
