# scan_and_search
Use this script to scan a target and search metasploit framework to see if there are any exploits in it that would probably work on that version.
It's not perfect and does mess up, but if you watch it, it seems to work fine.
I wrote this script with some help from chatgpt 4, and while it's not great, it's pretty alright.
For use with bug bounties or ctfs.
